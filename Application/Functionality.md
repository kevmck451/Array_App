# Application



1. Controller 
2. Engine 
3. GUI 
4. Temp Sensor





## Localization
    - Monitoring of each channel (current view)
    - heatmap of anomalies or energy



## Classification



## Human Operator
    - inject channel data into headphones (full range)
    - different listening modes
    - parameters to change volume or frequency


maybe have a speaker out in front of the array that can be triggered between tests for demo purposes
