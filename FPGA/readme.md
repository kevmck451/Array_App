# FPGA SoC Setup




1. Creating a NixOS for an FPGA SoC
2. Initial Build for SD Card Image
3. Initial Installation on DE10
4. Developing Application and Maintenance





## FPGA Folder

- The Altera DE10 Nano uses Quartus to synthesize/place & route the HDL code to the FPGA 
- Quartus is only able to do this using an intel processor
- Nix is linux
- so in order to develop software on this device with Nix, a computer with intel processor and linux is needed





## Nix
    - Development Environment
    - Package Manangement
    - FPGA Interaction Tool Chain




## Design
