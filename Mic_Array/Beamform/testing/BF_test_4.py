# define the angle desired
angle = (0, 0) # 0 degrees azimuth / 0 degrees elevation


# calculate the delay for each microphone
# distance = rate * time
# time = distance / rate
# rate is speed of sound which calculated based on the air temp


# computer the FIR coefficients




# apply the FIR filter to mic signals



# sum filtered signals
