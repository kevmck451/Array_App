The issue was a race condition during boot where the Raspberry Pi’s USB-to-Ethernet adapters didn’t initialize in time, causing the br0 bridge to fail. This made the FPGA unreachable unless a manual SSH tunnel was used. The fix involved removing the static bridge declaration, disabling DHCP on the USB interfaces, and adding a systemd service that dynamically creates the bridge when the interfaces become available. This ensures reliable network setup regardless of device power-on order, eliminating the need for manual recovery steps.
