sudo reboot

2: worked:
	ssh -L 7654:192.168.1.201:2048 admin@192.168.1.1 was run
	then app could connect to both mic and pi

pi power cable unplugged

3: worked:
	app was running
	pi connected, but not fpga
	ssh -L 7654:192.168.1.201:2048 admin@192.168.1.1 was run but no fpga status change
	turned app off and back on and fpga status was good. both were good


	unplugged the fpga to put flash drive in and it said the temp sensor also wasnt connected which is weird
